# Concerned by privacy

I recently took a photography course and started enjoying shooting pictures with my DSLR. As a photographer, I found myself being more attracted by nature than people. A couple of days ago, however, I went to a local shopping mall, indending to get some long exposures of the escalators.

I just walked into the mall, prepared the tripod, assembled ND filters on top of my lens and started calculating a proper value for the shutter speed. Suddenly, a private guard approaches me and asks what I'm doing and whether I'm authorized to take pictures inside the mall.

I wasn't obviously authorized, and still today can't say who should I ask for, and if I really need to be authorized to take a picture of an object in a private place open to the public. Anyway, I tried to explain that I wasn't interested in the people walking around - the shutter speed wouldn't allow me to get a clear picture of anyone - and was really trying to just get a shot of the escalator.

That was too difficult to understand for the guard, and we started arguing. I don't like that kind of people - this did not help in calming down the situation, and he was speaking to me like if he had the power to beat my face to the ground and handcuff me. At the end of the day, the only thing he was able to do was to say "I call the police" and walk away (yes, because there is usually, and deliberately, very little or not at all mobile network in Italy's malls).

This is when everything started to get paradoxal. A woman, roughly 60 years old, noticed what was going on, and started supporting the guard. She said that I was not allowed to take any picture "because that would be a privacy violation".

Initially, I was astonished of being accused of privacy violation. I do all my best in my everyday life to raise awareness in people about privacy, especially in the digital world. She was probably carrying her smartphone having all kind of weird apps installed, having no ad/cookie-blocking extensions for her browser, not even knowing what all this stuff means. She likely filled with her personal data dozens of paper forms for all types of points collections, or discount coupons, or similar things before, but she felt violated by someone taking a picture in the shopping mall. I believe that, if she did not see the guard and me discussing, she would have passed by.

The weird thing in all this story is that, according to italian law, you can legally take any picture from *outside* a building (and in this case, the walls of the mall are made of glass), because the law allows you to take pictures of fa√ßades. So, I could have shoot almost the same frame legally by stepping outside the mall and increase slightly the focal length.

I wasn't interested in disputing and packed my stuff, apologised the guard, and left the mall. Later, I realized that these that made me nervous in the first place, are actually good signs that people seem to start caring about "privacy", whatever it means for them. But now we should focus on shaping this concept a little bit.
